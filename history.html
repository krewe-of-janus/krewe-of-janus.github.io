          The Krewe of Janus is a non-parading organization founded in Algiers
          in 1948 by several friends who had all returned from the war. Janus
          staged its first ball at the Municipal Auditorium on February 20,
          1949. The ball was patterned after the old-line krewes and featured a
          strictly formal tableau presentation of the Royal Court, a Grand
          March, and Masker's Dances (callouts). The early balls featured
          elaborate costumes that illustrated the theme of the ball. But Janus
          also incorporated an element of entertainment in their balls, which
          would become one of the krewe's trademarks. Unlike most krewes, Janus
          did not hire entertainers but instead featured krewe members in
          humorous skits depicting scenes related to the theme in its Grand
          Finale.

          After staging successful balls in 1949 and 1950, Janus paused its
          activity for a few years while their members were recalled to military
          service. Returning in 1952, Janus chose Chase Dickey to be its
          Captain. Mr. Dickey filled that role for 50 years, retiring in 2002 as
          one of the longest serving captains in local Carnival circles. Chuck
          Dickey, his son, then took over as captain.

          Ball dates were assigned in the Auditorium according to seniority and
          as a result, Janus and many others staged their balls on a weeknight.
          With a 9:00 P.M. start time, and a breakfast downtown following the
          ball, the event extended well into the morning, which was problematic
          for some members and guests. To secure a weekend ball date, Janus left
          the Auditorium in 1987 and moved to a downtown hotel where the ball
          has been staged ever since.

          Formerly a West Bank-based group, today's members of Janus come from a
          variety of communities in several states. And though their addresses
          may have changed, many of the names have remained the same, as the
          sons and grandsons populate the krewe. And this year's Janus ball will
          look remarkably similar to those from the early years. Recent finales
          were inspired by Bruno Mars, Michael Jackson, Queen, and Disney
          Princesses. Satire rules the skits, which have skewered public
          officials, billboard lawyers, and the Sewerage and Water Board. One
          never knows what to expect at a Janus ball.

          Chuck Dickey stepped down as Captain after 14 years in 2023, and
          combined he and his father directed the Krewe's activities for a
          combined 71 years.
